<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Microtubules alternate between periods of slow growth and moments of quick shortening. This switch from growth to shortening is often referred to as ‚Äúmicrotubule catastrophe.‚Äù Using the dataset provided by Gardner, Zanic and coworkers, we analyze the dynamics of microtubule catastrophe with two main aims:
Aim 1) To perform data validation. In their experiment, microtubules were studied using fluorescent markers. We confirm that these fluorescent markers do not affect microtubule behavior by comparing results between labeled and unlabeled tubulin.
Aim 2) To investigate possible models for microtubule catastrophe. We look at two proposed models for the generative distribution: that catastrophe times are gamma distributed, or that catastrophe depends on the arrival of two poisson processes. We look at various datasets to determine which model best describes the observed results.</p>
