<p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037">Gardner, Zanic, and coworkers</a> investigated  the dynamics of microtubule catastrophe, the switching of a microtubule from a growing to  a shrinking state. In particular, they were interested in the time between the start of  growth of a microtubule and   the catastrophe event. They monitored microtubules by using  tubulin (the monomer   that comprises a microtubule) that was labeled with a fluorescent  marker. As a control   to make sure that fluorescent labels and exposure to laser light  did not affect the   microtubule dynamics, they performed a similar experiment using  differential interference   contrast (DIC) microscopy. They measured the time until  catastrophe with labeled and unlabeled tubulin.
Microtubules are dynamic filaments whose ends alternate between periods of slow growth  and rapid shortening as they explore intracellular space and move organelles. A key question  is how regulatory proteins modulate catastrophe, the conversion from growth to shortening. To  study this process, we reconstituted microtubule dynamics in the absence and presence of the  kinesin-8 Kip3 and the kinesin-13 MCAK. Surprisingly, we found that, even in the absence of the  kinesins, the microtubule catastrophe frequency depends on the age of the microtubule, indicating  that catastrophe is a multistep process. Kip3 slowed microtubule growth in a length-dependent manner  and increased the rate of aging. In contrast, MCAK eliminated the aging process. Thus, both kinesins  are catastrophe factors; Kip3 mediates fine control of microtubule length by narrowing the distribution  of maximum lengths prior to catastrophe, whereas MCAK promotes rapid restructuring of the microtubule  cytoskeleton by making catastrophe a first-order random process.</p>
