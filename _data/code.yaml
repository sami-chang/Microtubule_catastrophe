    Analysis of microtubule catastrophe, comparing two possible models of dyanmics. In one model, the catastrophe times were Gamma distributed, and in another, they were distributed according to the following story: The arrival of two successive Poisson processes (with different rates) immediately trigger microtubule catastrophe..
