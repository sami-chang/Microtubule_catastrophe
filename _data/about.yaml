  by Differential Control of Catastrophe

Abstract: >
  Microtubules alternate between periods of slow growth and moments of quick shortening.
  This switch from growth to shortening is often referred to as "microtubule catastrophe."
  Using the dataset provided by Gardner, Zanic and coworkers, we analyze the dynamics
  of microtubule catastrophe with two main aims:
  
  Aim 1) To perform data validation. In their experiment, microtubules were studied using
  fluorescent markers. We confirm that these fluorescent markers do not affect
  microtubule behavior by comparing results between labeled and unlabeled tubulin.
  
  Aim 2) To investigate possible models for microtubule catastrophe. We look at
  two proposed models for the generative distribution:
  that catastrophe times are gamma distributed,
  or that catastrophe depends on the arrival of two poisson processes.
  We look at various datasets to determine which model best describes the observed results.
