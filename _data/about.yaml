  Investigating the dynamics of Microtubule Catastrophe

Abstract: >
  [Gardner, Zanic, and coworkers](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037) investigated 
  the dynamics of microtubule catastrophe, the switching of a microtubule from a growing to 
  a shrinking state. In particular, they were interested in the time between the start of 
  growth of a microtubule and   the catastrophe event. They monitored microtubules by using 
  tubulin (the monomer   that comprises a microtubule) that was labeled with a fluorescent 
  marker. As a control   to make sure that fluorescent labels and exposure to laser light 
  did not affect the   microtubule dynamics, they performed a similar experiment using 
  differential interference   contrast (DIC) microscopy. They measured the time until 
  catastrophe with labeled and unlabeled tubulin.

  Microtubules are dynamic filaments whose ends alternate between periods of slow growth 
  and rapid shortening as they explore intracellular space and move organelles. A key question 
  is how regulatory proteins modulate catastrophe, the conversion from growth to shortening. To 
  study this process, we reconstituted microtubule dynamics in the absence and presence of the 
  kinesin-8 Kip3 and the kinesin-13 MCAK. Surprisingly, we found that, even in the absence of the 
  kinesins, the microtubule catastrophe frequency depends on the age of the microtubule, indicating 
  that catastrophe is a multistep process. Kip3 slowed microtubule growth in a length-dependent manner 
  and increased the rate of aging. In contrast, MCAK eliminated the aging process. Thus, both kinesins 
  are catastrophe factors; Kip3 mediates fine control of microtubule length by narrowing the distribution 
  of maximum lengths prior to catastrophe, whereas MCAK promotes rapid restructuring of the microtubule 
  cytoskeleton by making catastrophe a first-order random process.
